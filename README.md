# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Project
Project Theme : Mobile Price Prediction
In cooperation with Alexandra Britsa & Athina Gerolymou

This is a supervised machine learning project,taking data from a client that has opended a mobile company and we aim to determine a price range that indicates how high the price is likely to be.

We started pre processing our dataset, then building our machine learning model and finally evaluating it. You will also find attached our presentation in pdf file.
